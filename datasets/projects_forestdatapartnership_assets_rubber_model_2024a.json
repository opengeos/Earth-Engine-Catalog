    "description": "\n**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed.  Please see the GitHub \nREADME associated with this model for more information.**\n\nThis image collection provides per-pixel probability that the underlying\narea is occupied by rubber trees.\n\nThe probability estimates are provided at 10 meter resolution, and have\nbeen generated by a machine learning model. This dataset corresponds to \n2020 and 2023 output from model 2024a in the \n[Forest Data Partnership repo](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models/rubber) \non Github.\n\nThe primary purpose of this image collection is to support the mission of \nthe [Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/) \nwhich aims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity production \nby collaboratively improving global monitoring, supply chain tracking,\nand restoration. \n\n**Note that this dataset has separate terms of use for commercial users of \nEarth Engine.  Please see \"Terms of Use\" tab for details.**\n\nThis community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data\nbecomes available from the community and the model used to produce the\nmaps continuously improves. To provide map-based feedback on this\ncollection, please see our\n[Collect Earth Online instance](https://app.collect.earth/collection?projectId=50862)\nand follow\n[these instructions](https://collect-earth-online-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/simplified.html).\n\nIf you would like to provide general feedback or additional datasets to\nimprove these layers, please reach out through\n[this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).\n\n**Limitations**: Model output is limited to selected countries as calendar\nyear composites for 2020 and 2023. Not all regions of the output are\nrepresented by training data. Accuracy is reported in aggregate, is based\non a notional threshold, and will vary geographically and with user chosen\nthresholds. Sensor artifacts based on data availability, cross-track\nnonuniformity, or cloudiness may be visually apparent in output\nprobabilities and result in classification errors at some thresholds.\nGeographic scope:  SE Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia,\nPhilippines, Hainan Island), Africa (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana).\n\n\n",
