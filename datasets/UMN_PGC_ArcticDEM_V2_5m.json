The 2m asset is a collection of strips rather\nthan a single mosaic due to projection differences between strips.\n\nMosaicked DEM files are compiled from the best quality strip DEM files\nwhich have been blended and feathered to reduce void areas and edge-matching\nartifacts. Filtered IceSAT altimetry data has been applied to the raster\nfiles to improve absolute accuracy.\n",
