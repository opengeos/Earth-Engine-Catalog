    "description": "**If you are interested in accessing the KBA dataset please complete the\n[KBA data request form](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/request-gis-data)\nwhich will allow access directly in GEE once approved.**\n\nKey Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are 'sites contributing\nsignificantly to the global persistence of biodiversity\u2019,\nin terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Sites\ncan be identified as KBAs if they meet at least one of\nthe KBA criteria set out in the KBA Standard (IUCN, 2016) for threatened or geographically\nrestricted species or ecosystems, ecological integrity, biological processes, or\nirreplaceability. Both tabular and spatial data for KBAs are\nmanaged in the World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas (WDKBA).\n\nThe identification of KBAs draws upon the efforts of huge networks\nof local experts and relies on locally collected data. The process\nto reassess existing or identify new KBAs, is highly inclusive,\nconsultative and nationally driven. Anyone with appropriate data may\npropose a site as a KBA, although consultation with relevant stakeholders\nat the local and national level is required when identifying the site and\nneeds to be documented in the proposal. KBAs can be identified by a KBA\nNational Coordination Group (KBA NCG) if this has been established in a\ncountry or by an individual or small group of proposers. Further information\nabout KBAs can be found on the [KBA website](https://www.keybiodiversityareas.org/).\n\n**Data Sources.** Sites of importance for biodiversity that had been identified using other\npre-existing criteria formed the basis of the KBA dataset prior to the\nlaunch of the KBA Standard in 2016. These were principally the Important\nBird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) identified by BirdLife International,\nplus Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites and KBAs covering multiple\ntaxonomic groups in freshwater, marine and terrestrial systems under previously\npublished criteria. Since 2016, many of these sites have been reassessed\nagainst the Global Standard.\nCurrently, the global KBA network consists of >16,500 sites and these are classified\nas Global (those meeting Global KBA criteria), Regional (those not meeting Global KBA\ncriteria but continuing\tto meet other pre-existing criteria) or Global/ Regional to\nbe determined (those legacy sites with insufficient information to demonstrate whether\nthey meet Global KBA criteria). Further details about the current KBA dataset are published\non the KBA website.\n\n**Asset Naming Conventions.** An updated version of the WDKBA is currently\nreleased every six months. The most recent version is permanently available\nas projects/ee-kbas-in-gee/assets/current. Previous versions, starting from\nMarch 2025, are available in the format projects/ee-kbas-in-gee/assets/YYYYMM.\n",
