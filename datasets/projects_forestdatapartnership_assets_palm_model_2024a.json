    "description": "\n**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed.  Please see the GitHub \nREADME associated with this model for more information.**\n\nThis image collection provides per-pixel probability that the underlying\narea is occupied by palm.\n\nThe probability estimates are provided at 10 meter resolution, and have\nbeen generated by a machine learning model. This dataset corresponds to \n2020 and 2023 output from model 2024a in the \n[Forest Data Partnership repo](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models/palm) \non Github.\n\nThe primary purpose of this image collection is to support the mission of \nthe [Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/) \nwhich aims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity production \nby collaboratively improving global monitoring, supply chain tracking,\nand restoration. \n\n**Note that this dataset has separate terms of use for commercial users of \nEarth Engine.  Please see \u201cTerms of Use\u201d tab for details.**\n\nThis community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data\nbecomes available from the community and the model used to produce the\nmaps continuously improves. To provide map-based feedback on this\ncollection, please see our\n[Collect Earth Online instance](https://app.collect.earth/collection?projectId=50778)\nand follow\n[these instructions](https://collect-earth-online-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/collection/simplified.html).\n\nIf you would like to provide general feedback or additional datasets to\nimprove these layers, please reach out through\n[this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).\n\n",
