    "description": "The RGE ALTI dataset describes the digital elevation model (DEM) of France\nwith the pixel size of 1m.  It was created from surveys obtained by airborne\nlidar or by correlation of aerial images.\n\nLidar was deployed for flood-prone, coastal, and large forest\nareas. The vertical accuracy of the DEM in these areas is between\n0.2m and 0.5m. Radar was used in mountain areas (Alps, Pyrenees,\nCevennes, Corsica). Caution: in areas with steep slopes, the average\nvertical accuracy is the order of 7m.\n\nThe accuracy of these fields has been checked against various sources:\nthe road and hydrographic networks of the\n[BD TOPO](https://geoservices.ign.fr/bdtopo), geodetic terminals and\npoints calculated on the ground.\n\nAerial photo correlation techniques are used in the rest of the territory.\nOn certain zones treated by correlation, ground measurements are absent\nover large extents due to the presence of vegetation\n(wooded areas, for example). 1987-2001 altimetry data (BD Alti) are used\nto fill these gaps. The vertical accuracy of the DEM on these areas\nis between 0.5m and 0.7m.\n\nCurrently the collection includes a single image IGN/RGE_ALTI/1M/2_0/FXX\nshowing metropolitan France.\n\nThis dataset was prepared and ingested with the support of Guillaume Attard\nand Julien Bardonnet ([AGEOCE](https://www.ageoce.com)).\nThe preparation process is\n[described here](https://medium.com/@gui.attard/pre-processing-the-dem-of-france-rge-alti-5m-for-implementation-into-earth-engine-de9a0778e0d9).\n\nSee also:\n[user's guide](https://geoservices.ign.fr/sites/default/files/2021-07/DC_RGEALTI_2-0.pdf).\n\n",
