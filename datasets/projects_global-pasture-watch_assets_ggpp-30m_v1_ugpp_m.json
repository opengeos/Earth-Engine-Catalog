    "description": "This dataset provides global uncalibrated EO-based Gross Primary Productivity \nfrom 2000 at 30-m spatial resolution. \nProduced by the Land &#38; Carbon Lab Global Pasture Watch initiative, the current dataset provides \nGross Primary Productivity (GPP) values globally at 30-m spatial resolution from 2000 onwards. \nGPP values are modeled via a **light use efficiency (LUE)** approach, \nwhere [**GLAD Landsat ARD** (collection-2)](https://glad.umd.edu/ard/home) are aggregated every two months \n([Consoli et al., 2024](https://peerj.com/articles/18585/)) and combined with 1-km **MODIS \ntemperature** data and 1\u00b0 **CERES Photosynthetically Active Radiation** (PAR). \n\nTo keep the dataset flexible, the maximum light use efficiency (LUEmax) is set to 1 gC/m\u00b2/day/MJ \nfor **all land cover types**, allowing the users to later calibrate the \nGPP values according to specific land cover maps or regional conditions.\n\n**Bi-monthly uncalibrated Gross Primary Productivity (uGPP)** values (available in [OpenLandMap STAC](https://stac.openlandmap.org/gpw_ugpp.daily-30m/collection.json)) are averaged by each year and accumulated over the full 365-day period to produce\nglobal annual uGPP values, expressed in units of gC/m\u00b2/year.\n\n**Grassland GPP** values are computed on-the-fly using [GEE App](https://global-pasture-watch.projects.earthengine.app/view/ggpp-30m).\n\n**Limitations:** \n\n- **Input data resolution mismatch**: The dataset is provided at 30 m resolution, but key input variables for temperature (MOD11A1) \nand photosynthetically active radiation (CERES PAR) were derived from much coarser products (1 km and ~111 km, respectively).\nThe downscaling of this information can introduce uncertainty and may not capture fine-scale microclimatic conditions affecting plant productivity.\n\n- **Data artifacts**: The dataset contains known visual artifacts, including vertical stripes (\"stripe effect\") in some areas, which are a result \nof issues with the Landsat 7 sensor (Scan Line Corrector failure) and the subsequent gap-filling process used to create the underlying \nreflectance archive ([Consoli et al., 2024](https://peerj.com/articles/18585/)). These artifacts can disrupt the spatial continuity \nof GPP estimates during cloudy and snow cover periods\n\n- **Temporal resolution**: The data is produced at a bimonthly temporal resolution. This timeframe may not be sufficient \nto capture key growth periods or a plant's rapid responses (intense rainfall) to environmental changes, making \nit difficult to accurately capture productivity peaks and seasonal variation.\n\n- **Grassland calibration**: Grassland GPP values are calculated using a single maximum light use efficiency (LUEmax) \nparameter (0.86 gC/m\u00b2/year/MJ) for all global grasslands, based on the MOD17 algorithm. This value is not optimized \nfor specific grassland types or local conditions. As a result, the model shows a tendency to underestimate GPP when \ncompared to ground-based flux tower measurements.\n\n- **Dependence on grassland maps accuracy**: The accuracy of the grassland GPP values is contingent on the accuracy of the \nunderlying [GPW grassland maps](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/projects_global-pasture-watch_assets_ggc-30m_v1_grassland_c).\nAny misclassification of land cover in the source maps (e.g., shrublands or croplands identified as grassland) will \nlead to corresponding errors in the GPP estimates for those locations.\n\n**For more information see [Isik et. al, 2025](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.19774),\n[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15675358) and \n[Global Pasture Watch GitHub site](https://github.com/wri/global-pasture-watch)**",
