    "description": "The MODIS Fire_cci Burned Area pixel product version 5.1 (FireCCI51)\nis a monthly global ~250m spatial resolution dataset\ncontaining information on burned area as well as ancillary data. It is based\non surface reflectance in the Near Infrared (NIR) band from the MODIS\ninstrument onboard the Terra satellite, as well as active fire information from\nthe same sensor of the Terra and Aqua satellites.\n\nThe burned area algorithm uses a two-phase hybrid approach. In a first step\npixels with a high probability of being burned (called \"seeds\") are detected\nbased on the active fires. In a second one, a contextual growing is applied to\ncompletely detect the fire patch. This growing phase is controlled by an\nadaptive thresholding, where thresholds are computed based on the specific\ncharacteristics of the area surrounding each seed. The variable used to guide\nthe whole detection process is the NIR drop between pre- and post-fire images.\n\nThe dataset includes for each pixel the estimated day of the first detection of\nthe fire, the confidence level of that detection, and the land cover that has\nbeen burned (extracted from the ESA CCI Land Cover dataset v2.0.7). In addition,\nan observation flag is provided to identify the pixels that were not processed due\nto the lack of valid observations or because they belong to a non-burnable land\ncover.\n\nFireCCI51 was developed as part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI)\nProgramme, and it is also part of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\n",
