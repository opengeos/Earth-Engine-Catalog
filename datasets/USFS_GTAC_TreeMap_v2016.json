    "description": "This product is part of the TreeMap data suite. It provides detailed spatial\ninformation on forest characteristics including number of live and dead trees,\nbiomass, and carbon across the entire forested extent of the continental United\nStates in 2016.\n\nTreeMap v2016 contains one image, a 22-band 30 x 30m resolution gridded map\nof the forests of the continental United States circa 2016, with each band\nrepresenting an attribute derived from select FIA data (and one band\nrepresenting the TreeMap ID). Examples of attributes include forest type,\ncanopy cover percent, live tree stocking, live/dead tree biomass, and carbon\nin live/dead trees.\n\nTreeMap products are the output of a random forest machine learning algorithm\nthat assigns the most similar Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) plot to each\npixel of gridded LANDFIRE input data. The objective is to combine the\ncomplimentary strengths of detailed-but-spatially-sparse FIA data with\nless-detailed-but-spatially-comprehensive LANDFIRE data to produce better\nestimations of forest characteristics at a variety of scales. TreeMap is being\nused in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel\ntreatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial\ncarbon resources.\n\nTreeMap is distinct from other imputed forest vegetation products in that it\nprovides an FIA plot identifier to each pixel whereas other datasets provide\nforest characteristics such as live basal area (e.g., Ohmann and Gregory 2002;\nPierce Jr et al. 2009; Wilson, Lister, and Riemann 2012). The FIA plot\nidentifier can be linked to the hundreds of variables and attributes recorded\nfor each tree and plot in the FIA DataMart, FIA's public repository of plot\ninformation (Forest Inventory Analysis 2022a).\n\nThe 2016 methodology includes disturbance as a response variable, resulting in\nincreased accuracy in mapping disturbed areas. Within-class accuracy was over\n90% for forest cover, height, vegetation group, and disturbance code when\ncompared to LANDFIRE maps. At least one pixel within the radius of validation\nplots matched the class of predicted values in 57.5% of cases for forest cover,\n80.0% for height, 80.0% for tree species with highest basal area, and 87.4%\nfor disturbance.\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n* Please see the [TreeMap 2016 Publication](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/65597)\n  for more detailed information regarding methods and accuracy assessment.\n\n* The [TreeMap 2016 Data Explorer](https://apps.fs.usda.gov/lcms-viewer/treemap.html)\n  is a web-based application that provides users the ability to view and\n  download TreeMap attribute data.\n\n* The [TreeMap Research Data Archive](https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2021-0074)\n  for the full dataset download, metadata, and support documents.\n\n* [TreeMap Raster Data Gateway](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/rastergateway/treemap/)\n  for TreeMap attribute data downloads, metadata, and support documents.\n\n* [FIA Database Manual version 8](https://www.fia.fs.usda.gov/library/database-documentation/current/ver80/FIADB%20User%20Guide%20P2_8-0.pdf)\n  for more detailed information on the attributes included in TreeMap 2016.\n\nContact [sm.fs.treemaphelp@usda.gov](mailto:sm.fs.treemaphelp@usda.gov) with any\nquestions or specific data requests.\n\n* **Forest Inventory Analysis. 2022a.**\nForest Inventory Analysis DataMart.\nForest Inventory Analysis DataMart FIADB_1.9.0. 2022.
