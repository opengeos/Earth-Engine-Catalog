    "description": "### OFFL/L3_CH4\n\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of methane\nconcentrations.\n\nMethane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is, after carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), the most\nimportant contributor to the anthropogenically enhanced greenhouse effect.\nRoughly three-quarters of methane emissions are anthropogenic and as such, it\nis important to continue the record of satellite based measurements. TROPOMI\naims at providing CH<sub>4</sub> column concentrations with high sensitivity\nto the Earth's surface, good spatiotemporal coverage, and sufficient\naccuracy to facilitate inverse modeling of sources and sinks. TROPOMI uses\nabsorption information from the Oxygen-A Band (760nm) and the SWIR spectral\nrange to monitor CH<sub>4</sub> abundances in the Earth's atmosphere.\n[More information.](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/methane)\n\nCurrently, the following data quality issues are known, are not covered by\nthe quality flags, and should be kept in mind when looking at the methane\nproduct and also at preliminary validation results. For more details, see\nthe [MPC VDAF website](http://mpc-vdaf.tropomi.eu).\n\nFiltering on qa_value &lt; 0.5 does not remove all pixels considered bad.\nSome pixels with too low methane concentrations are still present:\n\n - Single TROPOMI overpasses show stripes of erroneous CH<sub>4</sub> values\n   in the flight direction.\n\n - Not all pixels above inland water are filtered.\n\n - Uncertainties for the XCH<sub>4</sub> is only based on the single\n   sounding precision due to measurement noise. For applications requiring\n   an overall uncertainty estimate, we propose to multiply the provided\n   error by a factor 2, which reflects the scatter of single sounding errors\n   in the TCCON validation.\n\n - Data prior to November 2021 only provides XCH<sub>4</sub> over land,\n   after which glint ocean observations were added.\n\n - No data are present between 2022-07-26 and 2022-08-31 due to a\n   [provider outage](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/news/News01082).\n\n### OFFL L3 Product\n\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find which areas within the product's\nbounding box contain data by using a command like this:\n\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20190223T202409_20190223T220540_07072_01_010202_20190301T221106.nc\ngrid_info.h5\n```\n\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (area-averaging values for\npixels that may have different values for different times).  From the\nmosaic, we create a set of tiles containing orthorectified raster data.\n\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air_validity>50;\nderive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(CH4_column_volume_mixing_ratio_dry_air, aerosol_height,\naerosol_optical_depth, sensor_azimuth_angle, sensor_zenith_angle,\nsolar_azimuth_angle, solar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__CH4____20190223T202409_20190223T220540_07072_01_010202_20190301T221106.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n### Sentinel-5 Precursor\n\nSentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017\nby the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near \nReal-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. \nThe NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more \nquickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit \n(which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single \nhemisphere).\n\nBecause of noise in the data, negative vertical column values are often\nobserved in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is\nrecommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e.\nfor vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.\n\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\nis performed).\n\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\n\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\nremove pixels with QA values less than:\n\n*  80% for AER_AI\n*  75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2\n*  50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2\n\nThe O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).\n",
