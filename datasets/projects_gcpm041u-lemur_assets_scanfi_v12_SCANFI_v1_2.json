    "description": "This data publication contains a set of 30m resolution raster files representing 2020\nCanadian wall-to-wall maps of broad land cover type, forest canopy height, degree of\ncrown closure and aboveground tree biomass, along with species composition of several\nmajor tree species. The Spatialized CAnadian National Forest Inventory data product (SCANFI)\nwas developed using the newly updated National Forest Inventory photo-plot dataset, which\nconsists of a regular sample grid of photo-interpreted high-resolution imagery covering all\nof Canada\u2019s non-arctic landmass. SCANFI was produced using temporally harmonized summer and\nwinter Landsat spectral imagery along with hundreds of tile-level regional models based on\na novel k-nearest neighbours and random forest imputation method.\n\nA full description of all methods and validation analyses can be found in [Guindon et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2023-0118).\nAs the Arctic ecozones are outside NFI\u2019s covered areas, the vegetation attributes in these\nregions were predicted using a single random forest model. The vegetation attributes in these\narctic areas could not be rigorously validated. The \"articExtrapolationArea\" band identifies these zones.\n\nData limitations:\n\n1. The spectral disturbances of some areas disturbed by pests are not comprehensively represented in the\ntraining set, thus making it impossible to predict all defoliation cases. One such area, severely impacted by\nthe recent eastern spruce budworm outbreak, is located on the North Shore of the St-Lawrence River. These\nforests are misrepresented in our training data, there is therefore an imprecision in the estimates.\n\n2. Attributes of open stand classes, namely shrub, herbs, rock and bryoid, are more difficult to estimate\nthrough the photointerpretation of aerial images. Therefore, these estimates could be less reliable than the\nforest attribute estimates.\n\n3. As reported in the [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2023-0118), the uncertainty of tree species cover predictions is relatively high. This\nis particularly true for less abundant tree species, such as ponderosa pine and tamarack. The tree species\nlayers are therefore suitable for regional and coarser scale studies. Also, the broadleaf proportion are\nslightly underestimated in this product version.\n\n4. Our validation indicates that the areas in Yukon exhibit a notably lower R2 value. Consequently, estimates\nwithin these regions are less dependable.\n\n5. Urban areas and roads are classified as rock, according to the 2020 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada\nland-use classification map. Even though those areas contain mostly buildings and infrastructure, they may\nalso contain trees. Forested urban parks are usually classified as forested areas. Vegetation attributes are\nalso predicted for forested areas in agricultural regions.\n\nThis dataset can also be downloaded from Canada's [\"Open Government\"](https://doi.org/10.23687/18e6a919-53fd-41ce-b4e2-44a9707c52dc) website.\n\nContains information licensed under the\n[Open Government Licence - Canada](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada)\n",
