    "description": "The In Situ TAC is a distributed centre organized around 7 oceanographic\nregions: the global ocean and the 6 EUROGOOS regional alliances. It involves\n14 partners from 11 countries in Europe. It doesn't deploy any observing\nsystem and relies on data, exclusively funded by other sources than\nCopernicus Marine Service.\n\nThis dataset contains sea surface current observations from High-Frequency\n(HF) radars. Sea surface currents measured by HF radar are an average over\nthe top 0.3-2.5 m of the water column, depending on the operating central\nfrequency.\n\nThis dataset provides total velocity components. It comprises gridded maps\nof total velocity fields of the surface current averaged over a time\ninterval. Total velocities are derived using an un-weighted least-square fit\nthat maps radial velocities, measured by individual measurement stations,\nonto a Cartesian grid. The final product is a map of the zonal and\nmeridional components of the ocean currents on a regular grid in the area of\noverlap of two or more radar stations.\n\nFor more details refer to this\n[user manual](https://documentation.marine.copernicus.eu/PUM/CMEMS-INS-PUM-013-048.pdf)\n",
