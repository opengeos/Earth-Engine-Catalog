    "description": "High resolution Red-Green-Blue (RGB) orthorectified camera images mosaicked\nand output onto a fixed, uniform spatial grid using nearest-neighbor resampling;\nspatial resolution is 0.1 m.  The digital camera is part of a suite of instruments\non the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) that also includes a\nfull-waveform LiDAR system and the NEON Imaging Spectrometer. In the\northorectification process, the digital imagery is re-mapped to the same\ngeographic projection as the LiDAR and imaging spectrometer data that is\nacquired simultaneously. The resulting images share the same map projection\ngrid space as the orthorectified spectrometer and LiDAR imagery. Since the\ndigital camera imagery is acquired at higher spatial resolution than the\nimaging spectrometer data, it can aid in identifying features in the\nspectrometer images including manmade features (e.g., roads, fence lines,\nand buildings) that are indicative of land-use change.\n\nSee [NEON Data Product\nDP3.30010.001](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30010.001) for\nmore details.\n\nDocumentation: [NEON DP3.30010.001 Camera imagery mosaic Quick Start\nGuide](https://data.neonscience.org/api/v0/documents/quick-start-guides/NEON.QSG.DP3.30010.001v1?inline=true&fallback=html)\n\nGet started by exploring the [Intro to AOP Data in Google Earth Engine Tutorial Series](\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/intro-aop-data-google-earth-engine-tutorial-series)\n\nBrowse and interact with AOP data in the [NEON AOP GEE Data Viewer App](\nhttps://neon-prod-earthengine.projects.earthengine.app/view/neon-aop-gee-data-viewer---desktop)\n",
