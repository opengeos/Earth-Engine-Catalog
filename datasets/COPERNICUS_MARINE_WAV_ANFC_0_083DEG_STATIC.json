    "description": "Static bathymetry for the Global Ocean Waves Analysis and Forecast\nsystem. This dataset provides the sea floor depth in meters.\n\nThe global wave system of Meteo-France is based on the wave model\nMFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the\ncomputing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with dissipation terms developed by\nArdhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on November 2014\nthanks to improvements obtained from the European research project\n'my wave' (Janssen et al. 2014).\n\nThe model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded\nglobal topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular\nwith decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the\npoles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is\nmore or less fixed with grid size 1/10 degrees. The operational\nmodel MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted\nwinds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is\ndiscretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035\nHz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters\nwith a time step of 6 hours. The global wave system provides\nanalysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at 0:00 UTC. The\nwave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell spectrum in\nprimary and secondary swells.\n\nGLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_001_027, implemented by Mercator Ocean\nInternational. It provides a comprehensive overview of the global\nocean wave analysis and forecasting system produced by Meteo-France.\nThe system delivers aggregated analyses and a 10-day forecast,\nupdated twice-daily, including various integrated wave parameters\nsuch as significant wave height, period, direction, and Stokes drift\nfor both the total wave spectrum and partitioned waves (wind wave,\nprimary and secondary swell).\n\n",
