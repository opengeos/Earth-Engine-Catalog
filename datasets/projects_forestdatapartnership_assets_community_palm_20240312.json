    "description": "This image collection provides per-pixel probability that the underlying\narea is occupied by palm.\n\nThese probability estimates are provided at 10 meter resolution, and have\nbeen generated by a machine learning model. Labeled examples of known palm\nand non-palm were supplied by community contributors to the Forest Data\nPartnership. The predictors are annual composites built from publicly\navailable satellite imagery provided by Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2,\nand ALOS DSM. Probability predictions are provided for an individual year,\ndenoted by the start and end time on each image in the collection. For the\ninitial version, predictions based on mosaics of 2020 imagery and 2023\nimagery are included. Methods are described in\n[this preprint](https://goo.gle/a_community_palm_model).\n\nThe community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data comes\nin from the community and the community model to produce the maps\ncontinuously improves. If you would like to provide feedback on these\nlayers, please visit our\n[Collect Earth Online](https://app.collect.earth/review-institution?institutionId=2494)\nproject to contribute.\n\nIf you are interested in contributing datasets to this effort,\n[please reach out through this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).\n\nThis dataset corresponds to the output from the\n[20240312 model on GitHub](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models).\n\nFor more information about the Forest Data Partnership, visit our\n[website](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/).\n",
