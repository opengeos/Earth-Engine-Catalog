    "description": "**Note: The associated paper, Oya: Deep Learning for Accurate Global\nPrecipitation Estimation, has not yet gone through formal peer review. It\nwould be released on arxiv soon.**\n\nOya is a quasi-global, high-resolution precipitation estimation dataset\nderived from geostationary (GEO) satellite observations.\n\nThe Oya model utilizes the full spectrum of visible and infrared (VIS-IR)\nchannels from a constellation of GEO satellites \u2014 including GOES-16/18,\nMeteosat-9/10, and Himawari-8/9 \u2014 to generate precipitation estimates\ncovering 60\u00b0N to 60\u00b0S.\n\nTo address the inherent data imbalance between rain and no-rain events,\nOya employs a two-stage deep learning approach. It combines two U-Net\nmodels: one specialized for precipitation detection and another for\nQuantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE). The models are\ntrained using high-resolution GPM Combined Radar-Radiometer Algorithm\n(CORRA) v07 data as ground truth and are pre-trained on IMERG-Final\nretrievals to enhance robustness.\n\nOya demonstrates superior performance compared to existing operational\nGEO-based baselines, such as the PERSIANN DynamicInfrared Rain Rate\n(PDIR-Now) and the Convective Rainfall Rate (CRR), across all precipitation\nintensities. It also outperforms Passive Microwave (PMW) based products like\nthe Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Early and is\ncompetitive with research-grade products like IMERG Final, which has a\n3.5-month latency. This dataset includes a half-hourly historical record\ngenerated from 2004 with a spatial resolution of 5km.\n\nLimitations:\n\n* Geographic Decline: Retrieval accuracy is highest in tropical zones and\n  degrades at higher latitudes. This is attributed to geostationary satellite\n  viewing angle effects, specifically limb darkening and parallax shift.\n* Topographic Challenges: The model shows reduced performance in arid and\n  high-altitude regions, notably the Tibetan Plateau.\n* Indirect Observation: As an IR/VIS-based product, Oya infers precipitation\n  from cloud-top properties rather than directly sensing raindrops (as radar\n  or passive microwave instruments do).\n\nGoogle makes no commitment about future updates to this dataset.\n",
