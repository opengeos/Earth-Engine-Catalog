    "description": "This dataset contains 15-day forecasts of the wave model fields\ngenerated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) at 0.25 degree\nresolution. We refer to these as Near-Realtime (NRT) because new products\nare released twice a day after the release of the ECMWF realtime forecast\ndata, of which this is a subset. Data may be distributed and used\ncommercially with\n[proper attribution](https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/licences/general/).\n\nProducts are available in Earth Engine starting with the implementation of\n[Cycle 49r1](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/FCST/Implementation+of+IFS+Cycle+49r1)\non 2024-11-12; earlier products are not included. For general information\nabout how to use ECMWF NRT datasets, see their\n[user documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/DAC/ECMWF+open+data%3A+real-time+forecasts+from+IFS+and+AIFS).\nSources files are available in the\n[Google Cloud marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/open-data-ecmwf).\n",
