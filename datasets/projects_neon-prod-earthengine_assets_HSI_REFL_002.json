    "description": "The NEON AOP Surface Bidirectional Reflectance is a hyperspectral VSWIR (visible\nto shortwave infrared) data product, containing 426 bands spanning wavelengths\nfrom ~380 nm to 2510 nm. Reflectance is scaled by a factor of 10000. Wavelengths\nbetween 1340-1445 nm and 1790-1955 nm are set to -100; these are water vapor\nabsorption bands without valid values. The dataset also contains QA\nraster bands. Major processing steps include orthorectification, plus atmospheric,\ntopographic, and Bidirecitonal Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrections.\nData are collected by one of three [NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS)](\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/imaging-spectrometer) sensors,\nAVIRIS-NG spectrometers built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). Reflectance is\nconverted to a mosaic using the nadir-most pixels from the flight lines acquired\nwith the least cloud cover. Spatial resolution is 1 m and spectral resolution\nis ~5 nm. The center wavelength and full width half max (FWHM) for each band are\nprovided in the Image Properties. Availability in GEE may not represent full\navailability in the NEON Data Portal (linked below). Additional sites and years\ncan be added to GEE upon request by emailing listaopgee@battelleecology.org.\n\nSee [NEON Data Product\nDP3.30006.002](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP3.30006.002) for\nmore details.\n\nGet started by exploring the [Intro to AOP Data in Google Earth Engine Tutorial Series](\nhttps://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/intro-aop-data-google-earth-engine-tutorial-series)\n\nBrowse and interact with AOP data in the [NEON AOP GEE Data Viewer App](\nhttps://neon-prod-earthengine.projects.earthengine.app/view/neon-aop-gee-data-viewer---desktop)\n",
