    "description": "Height of the top of canopy above bare earth (Canopy Height Model; CHM). The CHM\nis derived from the [NEON LiDAR](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/lidar)\npoint cloud and is generated by creating a continuous surface of canopy height\nestimates across the entire spatial domain of the LiDAR survey. The point cloud\nis separated into classes representing the ground and vegetation returns. The\nground classified points are used to generate a height-normalized point cloud that\nprovides a relative estimate of vegetation elevation. A pit-free surface is then\ngenerated using the height normalized vegetation points to produce the CHM. Any\ncanopy heights less than 2 m are set to zero for data collected with the Optech\nGemini LiDAR sensors, and less than 0.7 m for the Riegl Q780 and Optech Galaxy\nsensors. Data are mosaicked over the AOP footprint onto a spatially uniform grid\nat 1 m spatial resolution. Availability in GEE may not represent full availability\nin the NEON Data Portal (linked below).
