    "description": "The operational global ocean analysis and forecast system of Meteo-France\nwith a resolution of 1/12 degree is providing daily analyses and 10 days\nforecasts for the global ocean sea surface waves. This product includes\n3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the\ntotal spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes\ndrift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave,\nthe primary and secondary swell waves.\n\nThe global wave system of Meteo-France is based on the wave model MFWAM\nwhich is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code\nECWAM-IFS-38R2 with dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010).\nThe model MFWAM was upgraded on November 2014 thanks to improvements\nobtained from the European research project 'my wave' ,(Janssen et al.\n2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded\nglobal topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with\ndecreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At\nthe equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less\nfixed with grid size 1/10 degrees. The operational model MFWAM is driven\nby 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF\natmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and\n30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses\nthe assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours. The global\nwave system provides analysis 4 times a day, and a forecast of 10 days at\n0:00 UTC. The wave model MFWAM uses the partitioning to split the swell\nspectrum in primary and secondary swells.\n\nGLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_WAV_001_027, implemented by Mercator Ocean\nInternational. It provides a comprehensive overview of the global ocean\nwave analysis and forecasting system produced by Meteo-France. The system\ndelivers aggregated analyses and a 10-day forecast, updated twice-daily,\nincluding various integrated wave parameters such as significant wave\nheight, period, direction, and Stokes drift for both the total wave\nspectrum and partitioned waves (wind wave, primary and secondary swell).\n\n",
