    "description": "This early \"Public Preview\" dataset provides high precision data for methane emissions from\ndiscrete point sources. These methane emission fluxes were produced using a point source\ndetection and emissions quantification framework specialized to exploit the high spatial\nresolution, wide spatial coverage, and high precision of MethaneSAT data (methodology is\ndescribed in [Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023).)\nThe point source quantification framework was extensively tested in blind controlled-release\nexperiments as detailed in\n[Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023) and\n[Abbadi et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02439). \n\nTotal emissions for a scene\u2013from both dispersed area and point source emissions\u2013may be\nobtained by summing the area emissions and point source emissions for a given collection ID\n(see L4 Area Sources Public Preview).\n\nNot all data products (L3 concentration, L4 area and L4 points) are available for all\ncollection IDs. Contact the data provider for more information about the project at this link:\n[https://www.methanesat.org/contact/](https://www.methanesat.org/contact/).\n\n---\n\n7/2/2025 Important Update: \n\nAs you may be aware, we recently lost contact with the satellite. After exploring all possible  \nrecovery options, we have now confirmed that it is no longer functioning, due to an\nundetermined problem with the outer platform carrying our methane detector. While there is no\nquestion this is a setback, we are undeterred in our efforts to drive down methane pollution.\nPlease see our official statement here:\n[MethaneSAT Loses Contact with Satellite | MethaneSAT](https://www.methanesat.org/project-updates/methanesat-loses-contact-satellite).\n\nWhat this means for the Public Preview data: The existing datasets will remain accessible on\nGoogle platforms and on our web portal for the foreseeable future. Additionally, over the next\nfew months, we will release substantial new data collected by MethaneSAT prior to the loss of\ncontact. This will include hundreds of scenes (of targets that are roughly 200kmx200km). We\nhope this will be useful for you. Should there be any changes to data availability, we will\nnotify you well in advance.\n\nLooking ahead: While we don\u2019t have all the answers yet, we plan to leverage our advanced Data\nProcessing Platform (DPP) to quantify other streams of satellite and/or aerial data. We will\nalso take the necessary time to evaluate the best next step in our efforts to enable methane\nreductions.
