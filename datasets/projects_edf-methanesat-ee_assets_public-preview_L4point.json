    "description": "The methane emission fluxes were produced using a point source detection and\nemissions quantification framework specialized to exploit the high spatial\nresolution, wide spatial coverage, and high precision of MethaneSAT data\n(methodology is described in [Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023).)\nThe point source quantification framework was extensively tested in blind\ncontrolled-release experiments as detailed in [Chulakdabba et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-5771-2023)\nand [Abbadi et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c02439). Not all\ndata products are available for all collections.\nFor additional information about the MethaneAIR instrument, instrument\ncalibration and emission detections, please refer to recent publications by\n[Loughner et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0158.1),\n[Staebell et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-14-3737-2021),\n[Conway et al.
