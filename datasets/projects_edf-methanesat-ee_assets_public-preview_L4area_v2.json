    "description": "*The dispersed area emissions model is still in development and not\nrepresentative of a final product.*\n\nThis early \"Public Preview\" dataset provides high precision data for methane\nemissions from dispersed area sources. These emissions data come from the\nAppalachian, Permian, and Uinta basins in the United States; the Amu Darya and\nSouth Caspian basins in Turkmenistan; and the Maturin basin in Venezuela. These\nnovel measurements demonstrate the importance of quantifying total methane emissions\nwith high resolution to meet global methane mitigation goals.\n\nTotal emissions for a scene\u2013from both dispersed area and point source emissions\u2013may\nbe obtained by summing the area emissions and point source emissions for a given\ncollection ID (see L4 Point Sources Public Preview).\n\nDispersed area emissions are estimated from methane concentration observations\nin the form of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4) using\nan inverse model. An atmospheric transport model - the Stochastic Time-Inverted\nLagrangian Transport (STILT) model; [Lin et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003161),\n[Fasoli et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2813-2018); driven\nby meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental\nPrediction ([NCEP](https://www.weather.gov/ncep/)) Global Forecast System\n([GFS](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php))\n- is used to link variations in observed XCH4 to potential upwind sources.\n\nThese predictive linkages are used to invert an estimated set of emissions from the\nobservations of MethaneSAT using a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique nicknamed CORE\n(Conserved and Optimized Retrieval of Emissions). Inflow across the domain boundary and\npre-existing background concentrations are estimated, but not reported. \n\nThis set of initial observations made by MethaneSAT are consistent with\nindependent empirical data where available from other sources. Not all data products\n(L3 concentration, L4 area and L4 points) are available for all collection IDs.\nContact the data provider for more information about the project at this\nlink: [https://www.methanesat.org/contact/](https://www.methanesat.org/contact/).\n\n---\n\n7/2/2025 Important Update: \n\nAs you may be aware, we recently lost contact with the satellite. After exploring all possible  \nrecovery options, we have now confirmed that it is no longer functioning, due to an\nundetermined problem with the outer platform carrying our methane detector. While there is no\nquestion this is a setback, we are undeterred in our efforts to drive down methane pollution.\nPlease see our official statement here:\n[MethaneSAT Loses Contact with Satellite | MethaneSAT](https://www.methanesat.org/project-updates/methanesat-loses-contact-satellite).\n\nWhat this means for the Public Preview data: The existing datasets will remain accessible on\nGoogle platforms and on our web portal for the foreseeable future. Additionally, over the next\nfew months, we will release substantial new data collected by MethaneSAT prior to the loss of\ncontact. This will include hundreds of scenes (of targets that are roughly 200kmx200km). We\nhope this will be useful for you. Should there be any changes to data availability, we will\nnotify you well in advance.\n\nLooking ahead: While we don\u2019t have all the answers yet, we plan to leverage our advanced Data\nProcessing Platform (DPP) to quantify other streams of satellite and/or aerial data. We will\nalso take the necessary time to evaluate the best next step in our efforts to enable methane\nreductions.
