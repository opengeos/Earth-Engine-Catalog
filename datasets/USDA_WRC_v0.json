    "description": "This dataset depicts components of wildfire risk for all lands in the United\nStates that: 1) are landscape-wide (i.e., measurable at every pixel across \nthe landscape); and 2) represent in situ risk - risk at the location where\nthe adverse effects take place on the landscape.\n\nNational wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire\nintensity, generated by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Researc\nStation and Pyrologix LLC, form the foundation of the Wildfire Risk to\nCommunities data. Vegetation and wildland fuels data from LANDFIRE 2020\n(version 2.2.0) were used as input to two different but related geospatial\nfire simulation systems. Annual burn probability was produced with the USFS\ngeospatial fire simulator (FSim) at a relatively coarse cell size of 270\nmeters (m). The burn probability raster data was upsampled to the native\n30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data, to bring the data\ndown to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to\ncommunities. In this upsampling process, the provider also spread values of\nmodeled burn probability into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels\ndata as non-burnable.\n\nBurn probability rasters represent landscape\nconditions as of the end of 2020. Fire intensity characteristics were\nmodeled at 30 m resolution using a process that performs a comprehensive\nset of FlamMap runs spanning the full range of weather-related\ncharacteristics that occur during a fire season and then integrates those\nruns into a variety of results based on the likelihood of those weather\ntypes occurring. Before the fire intensity modeling, the LANDFIRE 2020 data\nwere updated to reflect fuels disturbances occurring in 2021 and 2022. As\nsuch, the fire intensity datasets represent landscape conditions as of the\nend of 2022.\n",
