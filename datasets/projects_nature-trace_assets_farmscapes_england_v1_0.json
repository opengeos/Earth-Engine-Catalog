    "description": "The Farmscapes 2020 dataset provides high-resolution (25cm) probability maps\nfor three key semi-natural features within England's agricultural\nlandscapes: hedgerows, woodland, and stone walls. This dataset was developed\nin collaboration with the Oxford Leverhulme Centre for Nature Recovery to\nserve as a baseline for applications including landscape restoration,\nbiodiversity monitoring, and ecological connectivity analysis.\n\nThe dataset was generated by applying a vision transformer model to a mosaic\nof high-resolution aerial imagery, trained using a large corpus of\nhuman-annotated labels. The output consists of three distinct probability\nlayers, one for each feature class. This probabilistic format allows users\nto apply custom thresholds to generate binary feature maps tailored to their\nspecific analytical requirements.\n\n**Limitations**\n\n* Geographic Scope: Model performance is reduced in dense urban\nenvironments and montainous areas, which were underrepresented in the\ntraining data that focused primarily on rural landscapes.\n* Temporal Accuracy: The source imagery was captured between 2018 and 2020.\nConsequently, the dataset does not account for landscape changes that have\noccurred since this period.\n* Class-Specific performance: The stone wall class exhibits lower\naccuracy compared to woodland and hedgerows, a result of\nsignificant class imbalance in the training data.\n\n**Europe Dataset**\n\nIn addition to the primary dataset for England, a preliminary version has\nbeen generated at a European scale. This dataset has not been subjected to\nthe same quantitative validation and should be considered experimental.\nIt is possible to request access to this dataset by submitting\n[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfokil1-UFfTxvVhihLx9W3-K51o900VF4ACqkwG1jYmP0W8g/viewform).\n",
