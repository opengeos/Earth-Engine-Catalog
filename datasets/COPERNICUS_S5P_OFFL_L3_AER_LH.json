    "description": "### OFFL/L3_AER_LH\n\nThis dataset provides offline high-resolution imagery of the UV Aerosol Index\n(UVAI), also called the Absorbing Layer Height (ALH).\n\nThe ALH is very sensitive to cloud contamination. However, aerosols and clouds can\nbe difficult to distinguish, and ALH is computed for all FRESCO effective cloud\nfractions smaller than 0.05. Cloud masks are available from FRESCO and VIIRS, and\nare strongly recommended to filter for residual clouds. A sunglint mask is also\navailable to screen sunglint regions, which are not filtered beforehand.\n\nIt is known that high surface albedos negatively influence the ALH, biasing the ALH\ntowards the surface. In general, the ALH over (dark) oceans is considered reliable\nto within the requirement of 1000 m or 100 hPa. Over land, especially bright surfaces,\nthe accuracy may be lower, and the use of the ALH product over bright surfaces like\ndeserts is not advisable.\n\nFor this L3 AER_LH product, the aerosol_mid_pressure is calculated with a\npair of measurements at the 354 nm and 388 nm wavelengths.  The\n[COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_SO2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S5P_OFFL_L3_SO2)\nproduct has the absorbing_aerosol_index calculated using the 340 nm and 380\nnm wavelengths.\n\n### OFFL L3 Product\n\nTo make our OFFL L3 products, we find areas within the product's bounding\nbox with data using a command like this:\n\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'aerosol_height_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time})'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__AER_LH_20190404T042423_20190404T060554_07630_01_010300_20190410T062552.nc\ngrid_info.h5\n```\n\nWe then merge all the data into one large mosaic (area-averaging values for\npixels that may have different values for different times).  From the\nmosaic, we create a set of tiles containing orthorectified raster data.\n\nExample harpconvert invocation for one tile:\n```\nharpconvert --format hdf5 --hdf5-compression 9\n-a 'aerosol_height_validity>50;derive(datetime_stop {time});\nbin_spatial(2001, 50.000000, 0.01, 2001, -120.000000, 0.01);\nkeep(aerosol_height,aerosol_pressure,aerosol_optical_depth,\n     sensor_zenith_angle,sensor_azimuth_angle,solar_azimuth_angle,solar_zenith_angle)'\nS5P_OFFL_L2__AER_LH_20190404T042423_20190404T060554_07630_01_010300_20190410T062552.nc\noutput.h5\n```\n\n### Sentinel-5 Precursor\n\nSentinel-5 Precursor is a satellite launched on 13 October 2017\nby the European Space Agency to monitor air pollution.  The onboard sensor\nis frequently referred to as Tropomi (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nAll of the S5P datasets, except CH<sub>4</sub>, have two versions: Near \nReal-Time (NRTI) and Offline (OFFL). CH<sub>4</sub> is available as OFFL only. \nThe NRTI assets cover a smaller area than the OFFL assets, but appear more \nquickly after acquisition.  The OFFL assets contain data from a single orbit \n(which, due to half the earth being dark, contains data only for a single \nhemisphere).\n\nBecause of noise on the data, negative vertical column values are often\nobserved in particular over clean regions or for low SO2 emissions. It is\nrecommended not to filter these values except for outliers, i.e.\nfor vertical columns lower than -0.001 mol/m^2.\n\nThe original Sentinel 5P Level 2 (L2) data is binned\nby time, not by latitude/longitude.  To make it possible to ingest the data\ninto Earth Engine, each Sentinel 5P L2 product is converted to L3, keeping\na single grid per orbit (that is, no aggregation across products\nis performed).\n\nSource products spanning the antimeridian are ingested as two Earth Engine\nassets, with suffixes _1 and _2.\n\nThe conversion to L3 is done by the [harpconvert](https://cdn.rawgit.com/stcorp/harp/master/doc/html/harpconvert.html)\ntool using the `bin_spatial` operation.  The source data is filtered to\nremove pixels with QA values less than:\n\n*  80% for AER_AI\n*  75% for the tropospheric_NO2_column_number_density band of NO2\n*  50% for all other datasets except for O3 and SO2\n\nThe O3_TCL product is ingested directly (without running harpconvert).\n",
