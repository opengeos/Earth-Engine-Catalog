    "description": "\n**Note: This dataset is not yet peer-reviewed. Please see this\n[GitHub README](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models)\nfor more information.**\n\nThis image collection provides estimated per-pixel probability that the\nunderlying area is occupied by the commodity.  The probability estimates are\nprovided at 10 meter resolution, and have been generated by a machine\nlearning model. For details, see the technical documentation on the\n[Forest Data Partnership repo](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main)\non Github.\n\nThe primary purpose of this image collection is to support the mission of\nthe [Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/) which\naims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity production by\ncollaboratively improving global monitoring, supply chain tracking, and\nrestoration.\n\nThis dataset currently covers the following countries: Brazil, Vietnam,\nIndonesia, Colombia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Honduras, Peru, Nicaragua,\nEl Salvador.\n\nThis community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data\nbecomes available from the community and the model used to produce the maps\ncontinuously improves. If you would like to provide general feedback or\nadditional datasets to improve these layers, please reach out through\n[this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).\n\nLimitations: Model output is limited to selected countries as calendar year\ncomposites for 2020 and 2023. Not all regions of the output are well\nrepresented by training data. Accuracy is reported in aggregate, and will\nvary geographically and with user chosen thresholds. Sensor artifacts based\non data availability, cross-track nonuniformity, or cloudiness may be\nvisually apparent in output probabilities and result in classification\nerrors at some thresholds.\n\n**Note that this dataset has separate terms of use for commercial users of\nEarth Engine. Please see \"Terms of Use\" tab for details.**\n\n",
