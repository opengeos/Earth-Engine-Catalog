    "description": "WeatherNext Graph is an experimental dataset of global medium-range weather\nforecasts produced by an operational version of Google DeepMind's\n[graphical neural network weather model](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1550/full).\n\nThe experimental dataset includes real-time and historic data. Real-time\ndata is any data that relates to a time that is no more than 48 hours in\nthe past (\"Real-Time Experimental Data\"), while historic data is any data\nthat relates to a time that is more than 48 hours ago (\"Historic\nExperimental Data\"). This dataset includes major surface fields including\ntemperature, wind, precipitation, humidity, geopotential, vertical velocity,\nand pressure. The spatial resolution is 0.25 degrees. Forecast init times\nhave 6 hour resolution (00z, 06z, 12z, 18z). Forecast lead times have 6\nhour resolution up to a max lead time of 10 days.\n\nIf you are interested in accessing the experimental dataset, please fill\nout this [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform).\n\nMore information on the model is in \"[Learning skillful\nmedium-range global weather forecasting](https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-1550/full)\".\nThe model used to produce this experimental dataset is an operational\nversion derived from that research model (formerly known as GraphCast).\nPlease note that the accuracy of this operational model may not directly\ncorrespond to the accuracy reported for the research model, and that\nadditional variables may be included in this forecast dataset.\n\nIf you have any questions on using this experimental dataset, or would\nlike to use it for purposes not currently permitted under the terms of use\nset out below, please contact weathernext@google.com.\n\n**Dissemination Schedule**\n\nAll steps are released at once. All times are in the UTC time zone and are\nrough  estimates (with typical \u00b1 15 minutes variance). On occasion, times\nmay vary up to \u00b1 60 minutes or more. If data delivery exceeds +60 minutes,\nplease inform us via weathernext@google.com.\n\nForecast runs (init time) | Forecast dissemination schedule\n:------------------------ | :------------------------------\n00:00                     | 06:45\n06:00                     | 12:45\n12:00                     | 18:45\n18:00                     | 00:45\n\n**Accessing Raw Data (.zarr)**\n\nA bucket containing the raw .zarr files for the historical dataset\n(\"Historic Experimental Data\") is available at `gs://weathernext/59572747_4_0/zarr`. To gain access to\nthe bucket, please request access through the same [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform?usp=preview),\nand note your interest in receiving access to the raw .zarr files.\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThe experimental data was generated by models which communicate with and/or\nreference the following separate libraries and packages:\n\n*   Data and products of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts\n    (ECMWF), as modified by Google.\n*   Modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information 2023.
