    "description": "*The dispersed area emissions model is still in development and not\nrepresentative of a final product.*\n\nThis early \"Public Preview\" dataset provides high precision data for methane\nemissions over wide areas from the oil and gas sector. This includes total\nemissions that come from discrete point sources and dispersed area sources.\nThese emissions data come from the Appalachian, Permian, and Uinta basins\nin the United States; the Amu Darya and South Caspian basins in Turkmenistan;\nand the Maturin basin in Venezuela. These novel measurements demonstrate the\nimportance of quantifying total methane emissions with high resolution to\nmeet global methane mitigation goals.\n\nDispersed area emissions are estimated from methane concentration observations\nin the form of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4) using\nan inverse model. An atmospheric transport model - the Stochastic Time-Inverted\nLagrangian Transport (STILT) model; [Lin et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003161),\n[Fasoli et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-2813-2018); driven\nby meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental\nPrediction ([NCEP](https://www.weather.gov/ncep/)) Global Forecast System\n([GFS](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php))\n- is used to link variations in observed XCH4 to potential upwind sources.\n\nThe sources of variation in observed XCH4 include 1) dispersed area emissions,\n2) discrete point sources, 3) inflow across the domain boundary, and\n4) the background concentration. Discrete point source emissions are\ndetermined individually using a divergence integral approach described by\n[Chulakadaba et al. (2023)](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-822/)\nand prescribed to the inverse model. XCH4 inflow across the domain boundary\nand dispersed area emissions are then estimated simultaneously using an\ninverse model with an enforced non-negative solution. Total emissions are\nthe sum of dispersed area and point source emissions.\n\nThis set of initial observations made by MethaneSAT are consistent with\nindependent empirical data where available from other sources.\nContact the data provider for more information about the project at this\nlink: [https://www.methanesat.org/contact/](https://www.methanesat.org/contact/).\n",
