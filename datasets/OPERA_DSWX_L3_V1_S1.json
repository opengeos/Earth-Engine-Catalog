DSWx-S1 provides near-global geographical\nmapping of surface water extent over land at a spatial resolution\nof 30 meters over the Military Grid reference System (MGRS) grid\nsystem, with a temporal revisit frequency between 6-12 days.\nUsing Sentinel-1 radar observations, DSWx-S1 maps open inland water\nbodies greater than 3 hectares and 200 meters in width, irrespective\nof cloud conditions and daylight illumination that often pose\nchallenges to optical sensors. Forward production of the DSWx-S1 data\nrecord began in Sept 2024.\n\nDocumentation:\n\n  * [DSWx-S1 Product Specification Document](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/opera/D-108761_OPERA_DSWx_S1AB_ProductSpec_Rev_A.pdf)\n  * [DSWx Product Suite Website](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/dswx-product-suite/)\n  * [DSWx-S1 Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document](https://archive.podaac.earthdata.nasa.gov/podaac-ops-cumulus-docs/web-misc/opera/atbd/D-108763_Rev_A_OPERA_DSWx_S1_NI_ATBD_20240530_SIGNED.pdf)\n",
