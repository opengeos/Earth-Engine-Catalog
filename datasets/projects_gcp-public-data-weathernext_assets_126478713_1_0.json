    "description": "WeatherNext Gen is an experimental dataset of global medium-range ensemble\nweather forecasts produced by an operational version of Google DeepMind's\n[diffusion-based ensemble weather model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9).\n\nThe experimental dataset includes real-time and historic data. Real-time\ndata is any data that relates to a time that is no more than 48 hours in\nthe past (\"Real-Time Experimental Data\"), while historic data is any data\nthat relates to a time that is more than 48 hours ago (\"Historic\nExperimental Data\"). This dataset includes major surface fields including\ntemperature, wind, precipitation, humidity, geopotential, sea surface\ntemperature, vertical velocity, and pressure. The spatial resolution is\n0.25 degrees. Forecast init times have 6 hour resolution (00z, 06z, 12z, 18z).\nForecast lead times have 12 hour resolution up to a max lead time of 15 days.\n\nIf you are interested in accessing the experimental dataset, please fill\nout this [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform).\n\nMore information on the model is described in \"[GenCast: Diffusion-based ensemble forecasting for medium-range weather](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9)\".\nThe model used to produce this experimental dataset is an operational\nversion derived from that research model. Please note that the accuracy\nof this operational model may not exactly correspond to the accuracy\nreported for the research model, and that additional variables may be\nincluded in this forecast dataset. The forecast dataset generated by the\nresearch model and which was used to generate the results in the above paper\ncan be found at `gs://weathernext/weathernext_gen_research_2019`.\n\nIf you have any questions on using this experimental dataset, or would\nlike to use it for purposes not currently permitted under the terms of use\nset out below, please contact weathernext@google.com.\n\n**Dissemination Schedule**\n\nAll 50 members of the ensemble forecast are released to BigQuery and Earth\nEngine. All members are released at the same time. All times are in the UTC\ntime zone and are rough estimates (with typical \u00b1 15 minutes variance). On\noccasion, times may vary up to \u00b1 60 minutes or more. If data delivery\nexceeds +60 minutes, please inform us via weathernext@google.com.\n\nForecast runs (init time) | Forecast dissemination schedule\n:------------------------ | :------------------------------\n00:00                     | 08:05\n06:00                     | 14:05\n12:00                     | 20:05\n18:00                     | 02:05\n\n**Accessing Raw Data (.zarr)**\n\nA bucket containing the raw .zarr files for the 2020-present historical dataset\n(\"Historic Experimental Data\") is available at `gs://weathernext/126478713_1_0/zarr`.\nAdditionally, 2019 historical forecasts, an extra year of forecasts evaluated in [\u201cProbabilistic weather forecasting with machine learning\u201d](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08252-9), are available at `gs://weathernext/weathernext_gen_research_2019`.\nThe 2019 forecast dataset is an additional year of forecast data, complementing the 2020-2024 data available through this dataset listing. The 2019 forecasts are, as in the paper, ERA5 initialized forecasts for a model trained on ERA5.\nTo gain access to those resources, please request access through the same [WeatherNext Data Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCf1JY8G78UDWzbm0ly9kJxfSjUIJT5WyMR_HiNqCm-IHIBg/viewform?usp=preview).\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nThe experimental data was generated by models which communicate with and/or\nreference the following separate libraries and packages:\n\n*   Data and products of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts\n    (ECMWF), as modified by Google.\n*   Modified Copernicus Climate Change Service information 2023.
